            "always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\r\n",
            "give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\r\n",

            "highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\r\n",
            "intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\r\n",
            "since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\r\n",
            "vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\r\n",
            "guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\r\n",
            "observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\r\n",
            "had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\r\n",
            "could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\r\n",
            "only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\r\n",
            "created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\r\n",
            "his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\r\n",
            "died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\r\n",
            "last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\r\n",
            "promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\r\n",
            "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\r\n",
            "might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\r\n",
            "one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\r\n",
            "within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\r\n",
            "that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\r\n",
            "not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\r\n",
            "pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\r\n",
            "benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\r\n",
            "must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\r\n",
            "insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\r\n",
            "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\r\n",
            "proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\r\n",
            "business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\r\n",
            "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\r\n",
            "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\r\n",
            "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\r\n",
            "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\r\n",
            "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\r\n",
            "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\r\n",
            "dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\r\n",
            "decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\r\n",
            "he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\r\n",
            "circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\r\n",
            "were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\r\n",
            "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\r\n",
            "him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\r\n",
            "doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\r\n",
            "and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\r\n",
            "hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\r\n",
            "resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\r\n",
            "the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\r\n",
            "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\r\n",
            "period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\r\n",
            "know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\r\n",
            "notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\r\n",
            "myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\r\n",
            "to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\r\n",
            "your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\r\n",
            "to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\r\n",
            "myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\r\n",

            "the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\r\n",
            "Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\r\n",

            "strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\r\n",
            "persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\r\n",

            "imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\r\n",
            "herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\r\n",

            "and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\r\n",
            "acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\r\n",
            "acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\r\n",
            "exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\r\n",
            "and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\r\n",
            "chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\r\n",
            "thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\r\n",

            "it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. “my dear mr. bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?” mr. bennet replied that he had not. “but it is,” returned she; “for mrs. long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” mr. bennet made no answer. “do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently. “you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.” this was invitation enough. “why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” “what is his name?” “bingley.” “is he married or single?” “oh, single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls!” “how so? how can it affect them?” “my dear mr. bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.” “is that his design in settling here?” “design? nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” “i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go--or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the party.” “my dear, you flatter me. i certainly have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” “but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “it is more than i engage for, i assure you.” “but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new comers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.” “you are over scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy.” “i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the others: and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good-humoured as lydia. but you are always giving her the preference.” “they have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.” “mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take delight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves.” “you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.” “ah, you do not know what i suffer.” “but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.” “it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.” “depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them all.” mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. her mind was less difficult to develope. she was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,-- “i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.” “we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes,” said her mother, resentfully, “since we are not to visit.” “but you forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him.” “i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two nieces of her own. she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her.” “no more have i,” said mr. bennet; “and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.” mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. “don’t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven’s sake! have a little compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.” “kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.” “i do not cough for my own amusement,” replied kitty, fretfully. “when is your next ball to be, lizzy?” “to-morrow fortnight.” “ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and mrs. long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.” “then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mr. bingley to her.” “impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?” “i honour your circumspection. a fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. but if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself.” the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense, nonsense!” “what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you there. what say you, mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection, i know, and read great books, and make extracts.” mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how. “while mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to mr. bingley.” “i am sick of mr. bingley,” cried his wife. “i am sorry to hear that; but why did you not tell me so before? if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on him. it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.” the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. “how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.” “now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said mr. bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife. “what an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was shut. “i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. at our time of life, it is not so pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes we would do anything. lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball.” “oh,” said lydia, stoutly, “i am not afraid; for though i am the youngest, i’m the tallest.” the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin. and when the party entered the assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: mr. bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man. mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. what a contrast between him and his friend! mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. his character was decided. he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr. bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it. “come, darcy,” said he, “i must have you dance. i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better dance.” “i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.” “i would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried bingley, “for a kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening; and there are several of them, you see, uncommonly pretty.” “you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said mr. darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet. “oh, she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” “which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said, “she is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt me; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.” mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous. the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. elizabeth felt jane’s pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned, therefore, in good spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. with a book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear. “oh, my dear mr. bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. i wish you had been there. jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. everybody said how well she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. only think of that, my dear: he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. first of all, he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance. so he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----” “if he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! for god’s sake, say no more of his partners. o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!” “oh, my dear,” continued mrs. bennet, “i am quite delighted with him. he is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the lace upon mrs. hurst’s gown----” here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy. “but i can assure you,” she added, “that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited, that there was no enduring him! he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man.”when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. “he is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible, good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!” “he is also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can. his character is thereby complete.” “i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. i did not expect such a compliment.” “did not you? i did for you. but that is one great difference between us. compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. what could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a stupider person.” “dear lizzy!” “oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.” “i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak what i think.” “i know you do: and it is that which makes the wonder. with your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone. and so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? their manners are not equal to his.” “certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.” elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. they were, in fact, very fine ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. they were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others. they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs. hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at netherfield house. he did look at it, and into it, for half an hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately. between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcy’s regard, bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. in understanding, darcy was the superior. bingley was by no means deficient; but darcy was clever. he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; darcy was continually giving offence. the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much. mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at st. james’s had made him courteous. lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was elizabeth’s intimate friend. that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate. “you began the evening well, charlotte,” said mrs. bennet, with civil self-command, to miss lucas. “you were mr. bingley’s first choice.” “yes; but he seemed to like his second better.” “oh, you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with her twice. to be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed, i rather believe he did--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something about mr. robinson.” “perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson: did not i mention it to you? mr. robinson’s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question, ‘oh, the eldest miss bennet, beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’” “upon my word! well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.” “my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, eliza,” said charlotte. “mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? poor eliza! to be only just tolerable.” “i beg you will not put it into lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.” “are you quite sure, ma’am? is not there a little mistake?” said jane. “i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.” “ay, because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.” “miss bingley told me,” said jane, “that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. with them he is remarkably agreeable.” “i do not believe a word of it, my dear. if he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage, and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise.” “i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long,” said miss lucas, “but i wish he had danced with eliza.” “another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i would not dance with him, if i were you.” “i believe, ma’am, i may safely promise you never to dance with him.” “his pride,” said miss lucas, “does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. if i may so express it, he has a right to be proud.” “that is very true,” replied elizabeth, “and i could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.” “pride,” observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, “is a very common failing, i believe. by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. a person may be proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.” “if i were as rich as mr. darcy,” cried a young lucas, who came with his sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.” “then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said mrs. bennet; “and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle directly.” the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would; and the argument ended only with the visit.the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit was returned in due form. miss bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the good-will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. it was generally evident, whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend, miss lucas. “it may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” “but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.” “remember, eliza, that he does not know jane’s disposition as you do.” “but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out.” “perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.” “your plan is a good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it. but these are not jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. she has known him only a fortnight. she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite enough to make her understand his character.” “not as you represent it. had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.” “yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce, but with respect to any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” “well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.” “you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.” occupied in observing mr. bingley’s attention to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. of this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. he began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. his doing so drew her notice. it was at sir william lucas’s, where a large party were assembled. “what does mr. darcy mean,” said she to charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?” “that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.” “but if he does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about. he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him.”mr. bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. she had a sister married to a mr. philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade. the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions: their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the head-quarters. their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr. philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr. bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr. bennet coolly observed,-- “from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced.” catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london. “i am astonished, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.” “if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.” “yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.” “this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree. i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.” “my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. when they get to our age, i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william’s in his regimentals.” “mamma,” cried lydia, “my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson’s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke’s library.” mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,-- “well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.” “it is from miss bingley,” said jane, and then read it aloud. nind “my dear friend, “if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never end without a quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. yours ever, “caroline bingley.” “with the officers!” cried lydia: “i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.” “dining out,” said mrs. bennet; “that is very unlucky.” “can i have the carriage?” said jane. “no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.” “that would be a good scheme,” said elizabeth, “if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.” “oh, but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley’s chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs.” “i had much rather go in the coach.” “but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure. they are wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are not they?”elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. the note was immediately despatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast. had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. she would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. after sitting a little while with jane, on miss bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected. “indeed i have, sir,” was her answer. “she is a great deal too ill to be moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass a little longer on your kindness.” “removed!” cried bingley. “it must not be thought of. my sister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal.” “you may depend upon it, madam,” said miss bingley, with cold civility, “that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.” mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. “i am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. you have a sweet room here, mr. bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting it in a hurry, i hope, though you have but a short lease.” “whatever i do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes. at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here.” “that is exactly what i should have supposed of you,” said elizabeth. “you begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her. “oh yes--i understand you perfectly.” “i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through, i am afraid, is pitiful.” “that is as it happens. it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.” “lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.” “i did not know before,” continued bingley, immediately, “that you were a studier of character. it must be an amusing study.” “yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. they have at least that advantage.” “the country,” said darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.” “but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.” “yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. “i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.” everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph,-- “i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. the country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, mr. bingley?” “when i am in the country,” he replied, “i never wish to leave it; and when i am in town, it is pretty much the same. they have each their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.” “ay, that is because you have the right disposition. but that gentleman,” looking at darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.” “indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing for her mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.” “certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.” nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance. his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile. elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away. “yes, she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sir william is, mr. bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! he has always something to say to everybody. that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.” “did charlotte dine with you?” “no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. for my part, mr. bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. but everybody is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are a very good sort of girls, i assure you. it is a pity they are not handsome! not that i think charlotte so very plain; but then she is our particular friend.” “she seems a very pleasant young woman,” said bingley. “oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself has often said so, and envied me jane’s beauty. i do not like to boast of my own child; but to be sure, jane--one does not often see anybody better looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my own partiality. when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. but, however, he did not. perhaps he thought her too young. however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.” “and so ended his affection,” said elizabeth, impatiently. “there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!” “i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said darcy. “of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. everything nourishes what is strong already. but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.” darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. she performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield. lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. she had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. she was very equal, therefore, to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear. “i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?” lydia declared herself satisfied. “oh yes--it would be much better to wait till jane was well; and by that time, most likely, captain carter would be at meryton again. and when you have given your ball,” she added, “i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.” mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all miss bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. the loo table, however, did not appear. mr. darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and mrs. hurst was observing their game. elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. “how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!” he made no answer. “you write uncommonly fast.” “you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.” “how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! letters of business, too! how odious i should think them!” “it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.” “pray tell your sister that i long to see her.” “i have already told her so once, by your desire.” “i am afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you. i mend pens remarkably well.” “thank you--but i always mend my own.” “how can you contrive to write so even?” he was silent. “tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley’s.” “will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice.” “oh, it is of no consequence. i shall see her in january. but do you always write such charming long letters to her, mr. darcy?” “they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.” “it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill.” “that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline,” cried her brother, “because he does not write with ease. he studies too much for words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?” “my style of writing is very different from yours.” “oh,” cried miss bingley, “charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.” “my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.” “your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.” “nothing is more deceitful,” said darcy, “than the appearance of humility. it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.” “and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?” “the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs. bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?” “nay,” cried bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, upon my honour, i believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this moment. at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.” “i daresay you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month.” “you have only proved by this,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now much more than he did himself.” “i am exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a circumstance, i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i could.” “would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?” “upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter--darcy must speak for himself.” “you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.” “to yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.” “to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.” “you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?” “will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?” “by all means,” cried bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of. i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.” mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. “i see your design, bingley,” said his friend. “you dislike an argument, and want to silence this.” “perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.” “what you ask,” said elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter.” mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. mrs. hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed, elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy’s eyes were fixed on her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. she could only imagine, however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she liked him too little to care for his approbation. after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her,-- “do you not feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?” she smiled, but made no answer. he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence. “oh,” said she, “i heard you before; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say ‘yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you dare.” “indeed i do not dare.” elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. he really believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger. miss bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth. she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance. “i hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after the officers. and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.” “have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?” “oh yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great-uncle the judge. they are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. as for your elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?” “it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.” at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself. “i did not know that you intended to walk,” said miss bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard. “you used us abominably ill,” answered mrs. hurst, “running away without telling us that you were coming out.” then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said,-- “this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into the avenue.” but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,-- “no, no; stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. good-bye.” she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. their powers of conversation were considerable. they could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object; miss bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation; mr. hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley’s salutation. he was full of joy and attention. the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire, to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door. he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards, and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr. hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. darcy took up a book. miss bingley did the same; and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with miss bennet. miss bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy’s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question and read on. at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! i declare, after all, there is no enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library.” no one made any reply. she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- “by the bye charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.” “if you mean darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing, and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards.” “i should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.” “much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say; but it would not be near so much like a ball.” miss bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. in the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said,-- “miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.” elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: mr. darcy looked up. he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him. “not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.” miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his two motives. “i have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. “you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, i should be completely in your way; and if the second, i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire.” “oh, shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heard anything so abominable. how shall we punish him for such a speech?” “nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said elizabeth. “we can all plague and punish one another. tease him--laugh at him. intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.” “but upon my honour i do not. i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! no, no; i feel he may defy us there. and as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. mr. darcy may hug himself.” “mr. darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried elizabeth. “that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. i dearly love a laugh.” “miss bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. the wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.” “certainly,” replied elizabeth, “there are such people, but i hope i am not one of them. i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good. follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, i own, and i laugh at them whenever i can. but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without.” “perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.” “such as vanity and pride.” “yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. but pride--where there is a real superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.” elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. “your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume,” said miss bingley; “and pray what is the result?” “i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect. he owns it himself without disguise.” “no,” said darcy, “i have made no such pretension. i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch for. it is, i believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself. my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lost for ever.” “that is a failing, indeed!” cried elizabeth. “implacable resentment is a shade in a character. but you have chosen your fault well. i really cannot laugh at it. you are safe from me.” “there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.” “and your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.” “and yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand them.” “do let us have a little music,” cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. “louisa, you will not mind my waking mr. hurst.” her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for it. he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made. the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough. she attracted him more than he liked; and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself. he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday: and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her. on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. miss bingley’s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits. they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth. they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort. much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.chapter xiii“i hope, my dear,” said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.” “who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming, i am sure, unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope my dinners are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.” “the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger.” mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled. “a gentleman and a stranger! it is mr. bingley, i am sure. why, jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley. but--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. lydia, my love, ring the bell. i must speak to hill this moment.” “it is not mr. bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life.” this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once. after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:--“about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i answered it; for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who, when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.” “oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “i cannot bear to hear that mentioned. pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure, if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.” jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail. they had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about. “it certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said mr. bennet; “and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn. but if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.” “no, that i am sure i shall not: and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. i hate such false friends. why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?” “why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.” right “hunsford, near westerham, kent, _15th october_. “dear sir, “the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since i have had the misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the breach: but, for some time, i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.”--‘there, mrs. bennet.’--“my mind, however, is now made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england. as a clergyman, moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. if you should have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se’nnight following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, “william collins.” “at four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said mr. bennet, as he folded up the letter. “he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, i doubt not, will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.” “there is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to discourage him.” “though it is difficult,” said jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.” elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required. “he must be an oddity, i think,” said she. “i cannot make him out. there is something very pompous in his style. and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. can he be a sensible man, sir?” “no, my dear; i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter which promises well. i am impatient to see him.” “in point of composition,” said mary, “his letter does not seem defective. the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i think it is well expressed.” to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. as for their mother, mr. collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters. mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. he was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but mrs. bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,-- “you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so oddly.” “you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.” “ah, sir, i do indeed. it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. not that i mean to find fault with you, for such things, i know, are all chance in this world. there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.” “i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more, but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted----” he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. they were not the only objects of mr. collins’s admiration. the hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. the dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing. but here he was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. he begged pardon for having displeased her. in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour.chapter xivduring dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. lady catherine de bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen better. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings, and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people, he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs. “that is all very proper and civil, i am sure,” said mrs. bennet, “and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman. it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. does she live near you, sir?” “the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park, her ladyship’s residence.” “i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?” “she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property.” “ah,” cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls. and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?” “she is a most charming young lady, indeed. lady catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.” “has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court.” “her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament. her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.” “you judge very properly,” said mr. bennet; “and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?” “they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.” mr. bennet’s expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure. by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers, mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her, in return, by sitting down to whist. “i know little of the game at present,” said he, “but i shall be glad to improve myself; for in my situation of life----” mrs. philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first there seemed danger of lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular. allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared not even mention that gentleman. her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there. “about a month,” said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand.” “yes,” replied wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. a clear ten thousand per annum. you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.” elizabeth could not but look surprised. “you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcy?” “as much as i ever wish to be,” cried elizabeth, warmly. “i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable.” “i have no right to give my opinion,” said wickham, “as to his being agreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. it is impossible for me to be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. here you are in your own family.” “upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield. he is not at all liked in hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.” “i cannot pretend to be sorry,” said wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him i believe it does not often happen. the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.” “i should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.” wickham only shook his head. “i wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.” “i do not at all know; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.” “oh no--it is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy. if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go. we are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world--a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.” elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry. mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. “it was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. i know it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them. society, i own, is necessary to me. i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. i must have employment and society. a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. the church ought to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.” “indeed!” “yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. i cannot do justice to his kindness. he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.” “good heavens!” cried elizabeth; “but how could that be? how could his will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?” “there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing. certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. i have a warm unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. i can recall nothing worse. but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.” “this is quite shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced.” “some time or other he will be--but it shall not be by me. till i can forget his father, i can never defy or expose him.” elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. “but what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?” “a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, i believe, very early in life. he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me.” “i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!” after a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “i do remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. his disposition must be dreadful.” “i will not trust myself on the subject,” replied wickham; “i can hardly be just to him.” elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!” she could have added, “a young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” but she contented herself with--“and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner.” “we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. my father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips, appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s death, mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself.” “how strange!” cried elizabeth. “how abominable! i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you. if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it.” “it is wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.” “can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?” “yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive. he has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.” “what sort of a girl is miss darcy?” he shook his head. “i wish i could call her amiable. it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud. as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she is nothing to me now. she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, i understand, highly accomplished. since her father’s death her home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.” after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,-- “i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley. how can mr. bingley, who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you know mr. bingley?” “not at all.” “he is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. he cannot know what mr. darcy is.” “probably not; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses. he does not want abilities. he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. his pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure.” the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. philips. the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance; that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy. “i know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.” mr. wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh. “lady catherine de bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.” “you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.” “no, indeed, i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherine’s connections. i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.” “her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.” this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another. “mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.” “i believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied wickham; “i have not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.” elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham’s attentions. there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house. the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together. recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,-- “sir william’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.” “i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.” “what think you of books?” said he, smiling. “books--oh no!--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.” “i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.” “no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.” “the present always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he, with a look of doubt. “yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy, that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was unappeasable. you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being created_?” “i am,” said he, with a firm voice. “and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?” “i hope not.” “it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.” “may i ask to what these questions tend?” “merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “i am trying to make it out.” “and what is your success?” she shook her head. “i do not get on at all. i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.” “i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.” “but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity.” “i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied. she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for in darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another. they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and, with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,-- “so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham? your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr. darcy’s steward. let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr. darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it. i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.” “his guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,” said elizabeth, angrily; “for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy’s steward, and of that, i can assure you, he informed me himself.” “i beg your pardon,” replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer. “excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.” “insolent girl!” said elizabeth to herself. “you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr. darcy.” she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness. “i want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case you may be sure of my pardon.” “no,” replied jane, “i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his sister’s, mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man. i am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr. darcy’s regard.” “mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself.” “no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton.” “this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy. i am perfectly satisfied. but what does he say of the living?” “he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.” “i have not a doubt of mr. bingley’s sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly, “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr. bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, i dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before.” she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. “i have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness. i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother, lady catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.” “you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy?” “indeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. i believe him to be lady catherine’s nephew. it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.” elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,-- “my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. you must, therefore, allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty. pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “hunsford,” and “lady catherine de bourgh.” it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr. collins allowed him to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth. “i have no reason, i assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. he answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of lady catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. it was really a very handsome thought. upon the whole, i am much pleased with him.” as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley’s two sisters. her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. when they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley. it was an animating subject, and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat opposite to them. her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. “what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.” “for heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.” nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. at length, however, mrs. bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies. she looked at jane to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley. she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave. she looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest mary should be singing all night. he took the hint, and, when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,-- “that will do extremely well, child. you have delighted us long enough. let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.” mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. others of the party were now applied to. “if i,” said mr. collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. i do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. the rector of a parish has much to do. in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. he must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” and with a bow to mr. darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man. to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased by mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room. he assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. there was no arguing upon such a project. she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins’s conversation to herself. she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy’s further notice: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in it. the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy said nothing at all. mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. mr. bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “lord, how tired i am!” accompanied by a violent yawn. when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. bingley was all grateful pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield. soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately. the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs. when they had gained their own room, jane, taking out her letter, said, “this is from caroline bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal. the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. you shall hear what she says.” she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr. hurst had a house. the next was in these words:--“‘i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. i depend on you for that.’” to these high-flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his. “it is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not hope that the period of future happiness, to which miss bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them.” “caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you. “‘when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that i despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.’ “it is evident by this,” added jane, “that he comes back no more this winter.” “it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should.” “why will you think so? it must be his own doing; he is his own master. but you do not know all. i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from you. ‘mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. with all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?’ what think you of this sentence, my dear lizzy?” said jane, as she finished it. “is it not clear enough? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard. can there be any other opinion on the subject?” “yes, there can; for mine is totally different. will you hear it?” “most willingly.” “you shall have it in a few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.” jane shook her head. “indeed, jane, you ought to believe me. no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection; miss bingley, i am sure, cannot: she is not such a simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one inter-marriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way. but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.” “if we thought alike of miss bingley,” replied jane, “your representation of all this might make me quite easy. but i know the foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.” “that is right. you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means. you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.” “but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?” “you must decide for yourself,” said elizabeth; “and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you, by all means, to refuse him.” “how can you talk so?” said jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that, though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate.” “i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion.” “but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. a thousand things may arise in six months.” the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline’s interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone. she represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart. they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. after lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again, during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins. elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “it keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and i am more obliged to you than i can express.” charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this was very amiable; but charlotte’s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr. collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. such was miss lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon. but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet. he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. his reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. in as short a time as mr. collins’s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained. sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. mr. collins’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. james’s. the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte’s dying an old maid. charlotte herself was tolerably composed. she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. her reflections were in general satisfactory. mr. collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. but still he would be her husband. without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. she resolved to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr. collins, when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and mrs. bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them. “my dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.” they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,-- “but is there not danger of lady catherine’s disapprobation here, my good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.” “my dear sir,” replied mr. collins, “i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.” “you cannot be too much on your guard. risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.” “believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth.” with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before. the possibility of mr. collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two: but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,-- “engaged to mr. collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!” the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,-- “why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?” but elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. “i see what you are feeling,” replied charlotte; “you must be surprised, very much surprised, so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you. but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic, you know. i never was. i ask only a comfortable home; and, considering mr. collins’s character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.” elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay much longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. the strangeness of mr. collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. she had always felt that charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. charlotte, the wife of mr. collins, was a most humiliating picture! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it, when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,-- “good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?” nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment: but sir william’s good-breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london. mrs. bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing could console and nothing appease her. nor did that day wear out her resentment. a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. mr. bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton. lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though mrs. bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return. jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. mr. collins’s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley’s continued absence. neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to jane’s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters, and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. as for jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing; and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. it needed all jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. he was too happy, however, to need much attention; and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed. “an excellent consolation in its way,” said elizabeth; “but it will not do for us. we do not suffer by accident. it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.” “but that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. pray, how _violent was_ mr. bingley’s love?” “i never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there be finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?” “oh, yes! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poor jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. it had better have happened to you, lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.” elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence. “i hope,” added mrs. gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. we live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.” “and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? mr. darcy may, perhaps, have heard of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley never stirs without him.” “so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane correspond with his sister? she will not be able to help calling.” “she will drop the acquaintance entirely.” but, in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley’s being withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane’s attractions. miss bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped, by caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth’s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. about ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged. they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring. mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well. here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.mr. collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough. “i confess,” said he, “that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship’s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings. i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival?” “i am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied sir william, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.” scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them. when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth,-- “do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter. i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.” while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas, who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st. james’s. as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria’s alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm. elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation. from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary. in spite of having been at st. james’s, sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented. when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. miss de bourgh was pale and sickly: her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. she inquired into charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others. in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to mrs. collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. lady catherine then observed,-- “your father’s estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think? for your sake,” turning to charlotte, “i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh’s family. do you play and sing, miss bennet?” “a little.” “oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day. do your sisters play and sing?” “one of them does.” “why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned. the miss webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. do you draw?” “no, not at all.” “what, none of you?” “not one.” “that is very strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.” “my mother would have no objection, but my father hates london.” “has your governess left you?” “we never had any governess.” “no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home without a governess! i never heard of such a thing. your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.” elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case. “then who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess, you must have been neglected.” “compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be idle certainly might.” “ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way. i am always glad to get a young person well placed out. four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe’s calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure. ‘lady catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?” “yes, ma’am, all.” “all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second. the younger ones out before the elder are married! your younger sisters must be very young?” “yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps she is full young to be much in company. but really, ma’am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. and to be kept back on such a motive! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.” “upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. pray, what is your age?” “with three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.” lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. “you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age.” “i am not one-and-twenty.” when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed. lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. a great deal more passed at the other table. lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many. sir william did not say much. he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collins’s side, and as many bows on sir william’s, they departed. as soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which, for charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. but her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy mr. collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.sir william stayed only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards. elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement. from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out. very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family. elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty. the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ----; and, to the great surprise of all the party, when mr. collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,-- “i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.” elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merely courtesied to him, without saying a word. colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usual way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,-- “my eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you never happened to see her there?” she was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. the subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. “what can be the meaning of this?” said charlotte, as soon as he was gone. “my dear eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.” but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. all field sports were over. within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. they called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former favourite, george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind. but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand. it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. he seldom appeared really animated. mrs. collins knew not what to make of him. colonel fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success. he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power. in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam. he was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all. himself. as to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. his countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. but no such recollection befriended her. she could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. but, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question. at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin’s corroboration. she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. philips’s. many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week. she remembered, also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr. darcy’s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of mr. darcy, she could not but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr. bingley was incomprehensible. she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd. “how despicably have i acted!” she cried. “i, who have prided myself on my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust. how humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind. but vanity, not love, has been my folly. pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were concerned. till this moment, i never knew myself.” from herself to jane, from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy’s explanation there had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. widely different was the effect of a second perusal. how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what charlotte’s opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane. she felt that jane’s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility. when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense of shame was severe. the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before. after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; mr. darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object. she could think only of her letter. “oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can. daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. and if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.” “you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan.” lady catherine seemed resigned. “mrs. collins, you must send a servant with them. you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. it is highly improper. you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. miss darcy, the daughter of mr. darcy of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. i am excessively attentive to all those things. you must send john with the young ladies, mrs. collins. i am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.” “my uncle is to send a servant for us.” “oh! your uncle! he keeps a man-servant, does he? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. where shall you change horses? oh, bromley, of course. if you mention my name at the bell, you will be attended to.” lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary--which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. reflection must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections. mr. darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. she studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. when she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. they were hopeless of remedy. her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for ever. anxiety on jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr. darcy’s explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost. his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! when to these recollections was added the development of wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. the very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh. when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both.the first week of their return was soon gone. the second began. it was the last of the regiment’s stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. the dejection was almost universal. the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family. “good heaven! what is to become of us? what are we to do?” would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “how can you be smiling so, lizzy?” their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago. “i am sure,” said she, “i cried for two days together when colonel miller’s regiment went away. i thought i should have broke my heart.” “i am sure i shall break mine,” said lydia. “if one could but go to brighton!” observed mrs. bennet. “oh yes!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable.” “a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.” “and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,” added kitty. such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house. elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy’s objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. but the gloom of lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton. this invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. a resemblance in good-humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their three months’ acquaintance they had been intimate two. the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs. forster, the delight of mrs. bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely to be described. wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. “i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia,” said she, “though i am not her particular friend. i have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older.” in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make her resigned. as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia’s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. he heard her attentively, and then said,-- “lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.” “if you were aware,” said elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you would judge differently in the affair.” “already arisen!” repeated mr. bennet. “what! has she frightened away some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia’s folly.” “indeed, you are mistaken. i have no such injuries to resent. it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining. our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia’s character. excuse me,--for i must speak plainly. if you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her character will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger kitty is also comprehended. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! oh, my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?” mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and, affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,-- “do not make yourself uneasy, my love. wherever you and jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three--very silly sisters. we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton. let her go, then. colonel forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. the officers will find women better worth their notice. let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.” with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition. had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation\n"

            "it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. “my dear mr. bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that netherfield park is let at last?” mr. bennet replied that he had not. “but it is,” returned she; “for mrs. long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” mr. bennet made no answer. “do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently. “you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.” this was invitation enough. “why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” “what is his name?” “bingley.” “is he married or single?” “oh, single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls!” “how so? how can it affect them?” “my dear mr. bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.” “is that his design in settling here?” “design? nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.” “i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go--or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the party.” “my dear, you flatter me. i certainly have had my share of beauty, but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.” “in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.” “but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.” “it is more than i engage for, i assure you.” “but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go, merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new comers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not.” “you are over scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy.” “i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the others: and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so good-humoured as lydia. but you are always giving her the preference.” “they have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.” “mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take delight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves.” “you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least.” “ah, you do not know what i suffer.” “but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.” “it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.” “depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them all.” mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. her mind was less difficult to develope. she was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. he had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,-- “i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.” “we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes,” said her mother, resentfully, “since we are not to visit.” “but you forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him.” “i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two nieces of her own. she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion of her.” “no more have i,” said mr. bennet; “and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.” mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. “don’t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven’s sake! have a little compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.” “kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.” “i do not cough for my own amusement,” replied kitty, fretfully. “when is your next ball to be, lizzy?” “to-morrow fortnight.” “ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and mrs. long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself.” “then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce mr. bingley to her.” “impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?” “i honour your circumspection. a fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. but if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i will take it on myself.” the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense, nonsense!” “what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you there. what say you, mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection, i know, and read great books, and make extracts.” mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how. “while mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to mr. bingley.” “i am sick of mr. bingley,” cried his wife. “i am sorry to hear that; but why did you not tell me so before? if i had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on him. it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.” the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of mrs. bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. “how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now.” “now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said mr. bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife. “what an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was shut. “i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. at our time of life, it is not so pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes we would do anything. lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next ball.” “oh,” said lydia, stoutly, “i am not afraid; for though i am the youngest, i’m the tallest.” the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr. bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from london, his five sisters and a cousin. and when the party entered the assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: mr. bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man. mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr. bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. what a contrast between him and his friend! mr. darcy danced only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. his character was decided. he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr. bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it. “come, darcy,” said he, “i must have you dance. i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better dance.” “i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.” “i would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried bingley, “for a kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening; and there are several of them, you see, uncommonly pretty.” “you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said mr. darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet. “oh, she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i dare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you.” “which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said, “she is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt me; and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.” mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous. the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs. bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. elizabeth felt jane’s pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned, therefore, in good spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. with a book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear. “oh, my dear mr. bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. i wish you had been there. jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. everybody said how well she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. only think of that, my dear: he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. first of all, he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance. so he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. then, the two third he danced with miss king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger----” “if he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! for god’s sake, say no more of his partners. o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!” “oh, my dear,” continued mrs. bennet, “i am quite delighted with him. he is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the lace upon mrs. hurst’s gown----” here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy. “but i can assure you,” she added, “that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited, that there was no enduring him! he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man.”when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him. “he is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible, good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!” “he is also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can. his character is thereby complete.” “i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. i did not expect such a compliment.” “did not you? i did for you. but that is one great difference between us. compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. what could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well, he certainly is very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a stupider person.” “dear lizzy!” “oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.” “i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak what i think.” “i know you do: and it is that which makes the wonder. with your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad,--belongs to you alone. and so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? their manners are not equal to his.” “certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her.” elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. they were, in fact, very fine ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. they were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others. they were of a respectable family in the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs. hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at netherfield house. he did look at it, and into it, for half an hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately. between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcy’s regard, bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. in understanding, darcy was the superior. bingley was by no means deficient; but darcy was clever. he was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; darcy was continually giving offence. the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much. mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge; where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at st. james’s had made him courteous. lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was elizabeth’s intimate friend. that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate. “you began the evening well, charlotte,” said mrs. bennet, with civil self-command, to miss lucas. “you were mr. bingley’s first choice.” “yes; but he seemed to like his second better.” “oh, you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with her twice. to be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed, i rather believe he did--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something about mr. robinson.” “perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson: did not i mention it to you? mr. robinson’s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question, ‘oh, the eldest miss bennet, beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’” “upon my word! well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.” “my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, eliza,” said charlotte. “mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he? poor eliza! to be only just tolerable.” “i beg you will not put it into lizzy’s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.” “are you quite sure, ma’am? is not there a little mistake?” said jane. “i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.” “ay, because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to.” “miss bingley told me,” said jane, “that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. with them he is remarkably agreeable.” “i do not believe a word of it, my dear. if he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage, and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise.” “i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long,” said miss lucas, “but i wish he had danced with eliza.” “another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i would not dance with him, if i were you.” “i believe, ma’am, i may safely promise you never to dance with him.” “his pride,” said miss lucas, “does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. if i may so express it, he has a right to be proud.” “that is very true,” replied elizabeth, “and i could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.” “pride,” observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, “is a very common failing, i believe. by all that i have ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. a person may be proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.” “if i were as rich as mr. darcy,” cried a young lucas, who came with his sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.” “then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said mrs. bennet; “and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle directly.” the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would; and the argument ended only with the visit.the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit was returned in due form. miss bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the good-will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising, in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. it was generally evident, whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend, miss lucas. “it may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.” “but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if i can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too.” “remember, eliza, that he does not know jane’s disposition as you do.” “but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out.” “perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.” “your plan is a good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it. but these are not jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. she has known him only a fortnight. she danced four dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite enough to make her understand his character.” “not as you represent it. had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal.” “yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt-un better than commerce, but with respect to any other leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.” “well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.” “you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.” occupied in observing mr. bingley’s attention to her sister, elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. of this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. he began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. his doing so drew her notice. it was at sir william lucas’s, where a large party were assembled. “what does mr. darcy mean,” said she to charlotte, “by listening to my conversation with colonel forster?” “that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.” “but if he does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about. he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him.”mr. bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. she had a sister married to a mr. philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade. the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family, catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions: their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was the head-quarters. their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr. philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr. bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr. bennet coolly observed,-- “from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time, but i am now convinced.” catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to london. “i am astonished, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.” “if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.” “yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.” “this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree. i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.” “my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. when they get to our age, i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so i do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william’s in his regimentals.” “mamma,” cried lydia, “my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson’s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke’s library.” mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,-- “well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well, jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.” “it is from miss bingley,” said jane, and then read it aloud. nind “my dear friend, “if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never end without a quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers. yours ever, “caroline bingley.” “with the officers!” cried lydia: “i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that.” “dining out,” said mrs. bennet; “that is very unlucky.” “can i have the carriage?” said jane. “no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.” “that would be a good scheme,” said elizabeth, “if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.” “oh, but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley’s chaise to go to meryton; and the hursts have no horses to theirs.” “i had much rather go in the coach.” “but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure. they are wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are not they?”elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. the note was immediately despatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast. had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. she would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. after sitting a little while with jane, on miss bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopes that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected. “indeed i have, sir,” was her answer. “she is a great deal too ill to be moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass a little longer on your kindness.” “removed!” cried bingley. “it must not be thought of. my sister, i am sure, will not hear of her removal.” “you may depend upon it, madam,” said miss bingley, with cold civility, “that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us.” mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. “i am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, i do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper i ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. you have a sweet room here, mr. bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting it in a hurry, i hope, though you have but a short lease.” “whatever i do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five minutes. at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here.” “that is exactly what i should have supposed of you,” said elizabeth. “you begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her. “oh yes--i understand you perfectly.” “i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through, i am afraid, is pitiful.” “that is as it happens. it does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.” “lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.” “i did not know before,” continued bingley, immediately, “that you were a studier of character. it must be an amusing study.” “yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. they have at least that advantage.” “the country,” said darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.” “but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.” “yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. “i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town.” everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph,-- “i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. the country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, mr. bingley?” “when i am in the country,” he replied, “i never wish to leave it; and when i am in town, it is pretty much the same. they have each their advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.” “ay, that is because you have the right disposition. but that gentleman,” looking at darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing at all.” “indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing for her mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.” “certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.” nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance. his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards mr. darcy with a very expressive smile. elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away. “yes, she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sir william is, mr. bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! he has always something to say to everybody. that is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.” “did charlotte dine with you?” “no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. for my part, mr. bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. but everybody is to judge for themselves, and the lucases are a very good sort of girls, i assure you. it is a pity they are not handsome! not that i think charlotte so very plain; but then she is our particular friend.” “she seems a very pleasant young woman,” said bingley. “oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself has often said so, and envied me jane’s beauty. i do not like to boast of my own child; but to be sure, jane--one does not often see anybody better looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my own partiality. when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. but, however, he did not. perhaps he thought her too young. however, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.” “and so ended his affection,” said elizabeth, impatiently. “there has been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!” “i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said darcy. “of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. everything nourishes what is strong already. but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.” darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs. bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. she performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield. lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. she had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. she was very equal, therefore, to address mr. bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear. “i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?” lydia declared herself satisfied. “oh yes--it would be much better to wait till jane was well; and by that time, most likely, captain carter would be at meryton again. and when you have given your ball,” she added, “i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.” mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all miss bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. the loo table, however, did not appear. mr. darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and mrs. hurst was observing their game. elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. “how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!” he made no answer. “you write uncommonly fast.” “you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.” “how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! letters of business, too! how odious i should think them!” “it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.” “pray tell your sister that i long to see her.” “i have already told her so once, by your desire.” “i am afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you. i mend pens remarkably well.” “thank you--but i always mend my own.” “how can you contrive to write so even?” he was silent. “tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley’s.” “will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at present i have not room to do them justice.” “oh, it is of no consequence. i shall see her in january. but do you always write such charming long letters to her, mr. darcy?” “they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine.” “it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill.” “that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline,” cried her brother, “because he does not write with ease. he studies too much for words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?” “my style of writing is very different from yours.” “oh,” cried miss bingley, “charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.” “my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.” “your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.” “nothing is more deceitful,” said darcy, “than the appearance of humility. it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast.” “and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?” “the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs. bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?” “nay,” cried bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, upon my honour, i believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this moment. at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.” “i daresay you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘bingley, you had better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month.” “you have only proved by this,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now much more than he did himself.” “i am exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a circumstance, i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i could.” “would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?” “upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter--darcy must speak for himself.” “you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety.” “to yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you.” “to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.” “you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?” “will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?” “by all means,” cried bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of. i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening, when he has nothing to do.” mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. “i see your design, bingley,” said his friend. “you dislike an argument, and want to silence this.” “perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.” “what you ask,” said elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and mr. darcy had much better finish his letter.” mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. mrs. hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed, elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy’s eyes were fixed on her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. she could only imagine, however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she liked him too little to care for his approbation. after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near elizabeth, said to her,-- “do you not feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?” she smiled, but made no answer. he repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence. “oh,” said she, “i heard you before; but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say ‘yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you dare.” “indeed i do not dare.” elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. he really believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger. miss bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth. she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance. “i hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after the officers. and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses.” “have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?” “oh yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great-uncle the judge. they are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. as for your elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?” “it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied.” at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and elizabeth herself. “i did not know that you intended to walk,” said miss bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard. “you used us abominably ill,” answered mrs. hurst, “running away without telling us that you were coming out.” then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said,-- “this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into the avenue.” but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered,-- “no, no; stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. good-bye.” she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. their powers of conversation were considerable. they could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object; miss bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation; mr. hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley’s salutation. he was full of joy and attention. the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire, to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door. he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight. when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr. darcy did not wish for cards, and mr. hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. she assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr. hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. darcy took up a book. miss bingley did the same; and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with miss bennet. miss bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr. darcy’s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. she could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question and read on. at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! i declare, after all, there is no enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library.” no one made any reply. she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,-- “by the bye charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.” “if you mean darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing, and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards.” “i should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day.” “much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say; but it would not be near so much like a ball.” miss bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. in the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to elizabeth, said,-- “miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude.” elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: mr. darcy looked up. he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. he was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his meaning--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him. “not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.” miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his two motives. “i have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. “you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, i should be completely in your way; and if the second, i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire.” “oh, shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heard anything so abominable. how shall we punish him for such a speech?” “nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said elizabeth. “we can all plague and punish one another. tease him--laugh at him. intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.” “but upon my honour i do not. i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! no, no; i feel he may defy us there. and as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. mr. darcy may hug himself.” “mr. darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried elizabeth. “that is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. i dearly love a laugh.” “miss bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. the wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke.” “certainly,” replied elizabeth, “there are such people, but i hope i am not one of them. i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good. follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, i own, and i laugh at them whenever i can. but these, i suppose, are precisely what you are without.” “perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.” “such as vanity and pride.” “yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. but pride--where there is a real superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.” elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. “your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume,” said miss bingley; “and pray what is the result?” “i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect. he owns it himself without disguise.” “no,” said darcy, “i have made no such pretension. i have faults enough, but they are not, i hope, of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch for. it is, i believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the convenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself. my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lost for ever.” “that is a failing, indeed!” cried elizabeth. “implacable resentment is a shade in a character. but you have chosen your fault well. i really cannot laugh at it. you are safe from me.” “there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.” “and your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.” “and yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand them.” “do let us have a little music,” cried miss bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. “louisa, you will not mind my waking mr. hurst.” her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for it. he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which would exactly finish jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. mrs. bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made. the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right. to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough. she attracted him more than he liked; and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself. he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday: and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her. on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. miss bingley’s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits. they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. the evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and elizabeth. they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort. much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.chapter xiii“i hope, my dear,” said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.” “who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming, i am sure, unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope my dinners are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.” “the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger.” mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled. “a gentleman and a stranger! it is mr. bingley, i am sure. why, jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley. but--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. lydia, my love, ring the bell. i must speak to hill this moment.” “it is not mr. bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life.” this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once. after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:--“about a month ago i received this letter, and about a fortnight ago i answered it; for i thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who, when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.” “oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “i cannot bear to hear that mentioned. pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and i am sure, if i had been you, i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.” jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail. they had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which mrs. bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about. “it certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said mr. bennet; “and nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn. but if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.” “no, that i am sure i shall not: and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. i hate such false friends. why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?” “why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear.” right “hunsford, near westerham, kent, _15th october_. “dear sir, “the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since i have had the misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the breach: but, for some time, i was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.”--‘there, mrs. bennet.’--“my mind, however, is now made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at easter, i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england. as a clergyman, moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. if you should have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday, november 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se’nnight following, which i can do without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. i remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, “william collins.” “at four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said mr. bennet, as he folded up the letter. “he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, i doubt not, will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.” “there is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to discourage him.” “though it is difficult,” said jane, “to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit.” elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required. “he must be an oddity, i think,” said she. “i cannot make him out. there is something very pompous in his style. and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose he would help it, if he could. can he be a sensible man, sir?” “no, my dear; i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter which promises well. i am impatient to see him.” “in point of composition,” said mary, “his letter does not seem defective. the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i think it is well expressed.” to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. as for their mother, mr. collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters. mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr. collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. he was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. his air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but mrs. bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,-- “you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so oddly.” “you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.” “ah, sir, i do indeed. it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. not that i mean to find fault with you, for such things, i know, are all chance in this world. there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.” “i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more, but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted----” he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. they were not the only objects of mr. collins’s admiration. the hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. the dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing. but here he was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. he begged pardon for having displeased her. in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour.chapter xivduring dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. lady catherine de bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen better. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings, and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people, he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs. “that is all very proper and civil, i am sure,” said mrs. bennet, “and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman. it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. does she live near you, sir?” “the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park, her ladyship’s residence.” “i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?” “she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very extensive property.” “ah,” cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than many girls. and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?” “she is a most charming young lady, indeed. lady catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.” “has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court.” “her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament. her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.” “you judge very properly,” said mr. bennet; “and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?” “they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.” mr. bennet’s expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure. by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr. bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the officers, mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her, in return, by sitting down to whist. “i know little of the game at present,” said he, “but i shall be glad to improve myself; for in my situation of life----” mrs. philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first there seemed danger of lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular. allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared not even mention that gentleman. her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there. “about a month,” said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i understand.” “yes,” replied wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. a clear ten thousand per annum. you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.” elizabeth could not but look surprised. “you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcy?” “as much as i ever wish to be,” cried elizabeth, warmly. “i have spent four days in the same house with him, and i think him very disagreeable.” “i have no right to give my opinion,” said wickham, “as to his being agreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. it is impossible for me to be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. here you are in your own family.” “upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except netherfield. he is not at all liked in hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.” “i cannot pretend to be sorry,” said wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him i believe it does not often happen. the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.” “i should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man.” wickham only shook his head. “i wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.” “i do not at all know; but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.” “oh no--it is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy. if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go. we are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world--a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.” elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry. mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. “it was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. i know it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them. society, i own, is necessary to me. i have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. i must have employment and society. a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. the church ought to have been my profession--i was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.” “indeed!” “yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. i cannot do justice to his kindness. he meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere.” “good heavens!” cried elizabeth; “but how could that be? how could his will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?” “there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. a man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing. certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. i have a warm unguarded temper, and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. i can recall nothing worse. but the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.” “this is quite shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced.” “some time or other he will be--but it shall not be by me. till i can forget his father, i can never defy or expose him.” elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. “but what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?” “a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, i believe, very early in life. he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me.” “i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!” after a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “i do remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. his disposition must be dreadful.” “i will not trust myself on the subject,” replied wickham; “i can hardly be just to him.” elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “to treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!” she could have added, “a young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” but she contented herself with--“and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest manner.” “we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. my father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips, appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence; and when, immediately before my father’s death, mr. darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself.” “how strange!” cried elizabeth. “how abominable! i wonder that the very pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you. if from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty i must call it.” “it is wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. but we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.” “can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?” “yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the pemberley house, is a powerful motive. he has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.” “what sort of a girl is miss darcy?” he shook his head. “i wish i could call her amiable. it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud. as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she is nothing to me now. she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, i understand, highly accomplished. since her father’s death her home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.” after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,-- “i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley. how can mr. bingley, who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you know mr. bingley?” “not at all.” “he is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. he cannot know what mr. darcy is.” “probably not; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses. he does not want abilities. he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. his pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure.” the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs. philips. the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. it had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance; that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy. “i know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.” mr. wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh. “lady catherine de bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.” “you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.” “no, indeed, i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherine’s connections. i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.” “her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.” this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss bingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another. “mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.” “i believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied wickham; “i have not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.” elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr. wickham’s attentions. there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs. philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she could think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and mrs. philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house. the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir william’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards bingley and jane, who were dancing together. recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,-- “sir william’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of.” “i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. we have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.” “what think you of books?” said he, smiling. “books--oh no!--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings.” “i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.” “no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.” “the present always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he, with a look of doubt. “yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy, that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was unappeasable. you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being created_?” “i am,” said he, with a firm voice. “and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?” “i hope not.” “it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.” “may i ask to what these questions tend?” “merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “i am trying to make it out.” “and what is your success?” she shook her head. “i do not get on at all. i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.” “i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.” “but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another opportunity.” “i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied. she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for in darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another. they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and, with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,-- “so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham? your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr. darcy’s steward. let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr. darcy’s using him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars, but i know very well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and i wonder how he could presume to do it. i pity you, miss eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.” “his guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,” said elizabeth, angrily; “for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr. darcy’s steward, and of that, i can assure you, he informed me himself.” “i beg your pardon,” replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer. “excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.” “insolent girl!” said elizabeth to herself. “you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr. darcy.” she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness. “i want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case you may be sure of my pardon.” “no,” replied jane, “i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr. darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has received; and i am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his sister’s, mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man. i am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr. darcy’s regard.” “mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself.” “no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton.” “this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy. i am perfectly satisfied. but what does he say of the living?” “he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from mr. darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only.” “i have not a doubt of mr. bingley’s sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly, “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr. bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, i dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before.” she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. “i have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness. i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother, lady catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.” “you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy?” “indeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. i believe him to be lady catherine’s nephew. it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.” elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,-- “my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. you must, therefore, allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty. pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,” “hunsford,” and “lady catherine de bourgh.” it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. mr. darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr. collins allowed him to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: mr. collins then returned to elizabeth. “i have no reason, i assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. he answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of lady catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. it was really a very handsome thought. upon the whole, i am much pleased with him.” as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like bingley’s two sisters. her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. when they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr. bingley. it was an animating subject, and mrs. bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. his being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. it was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs. bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat opposite to them. her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. “what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear.” “for heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. what advantage can it be to you to offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing.” nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity. at length, however, mrs. bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies. she looked at jane to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly talking to bingley. she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued, however, impenetrably grave. she looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest mary should be singing all night. he took the hint, and, when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,-- “that will do extremely well, child. you have delighted us long enough. let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.” mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. others of the party were now applied to. “if i,” said mr. collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. i do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. the rector of a parish has much to do. in the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. he must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. i cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” and with a bow to mr. darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr. bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to lady lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man. to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable. the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased by mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room. he assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. there was no arguing upon such a project. she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins’s conversation to herself. she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy’s further notice: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in it. the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manœuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsed every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy said nothing at all. mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. mr. bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “lord, how tired i am!” accompanied by a violent yawn. when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. bingley was all grateful pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield. soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and was opened immediately. the envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs. when they had gained their own room, jane, taking out her letter, said, “this is from caroline bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal. the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. you shall hear what she says.” she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr. hurst had a house. the next was in these words:--“‘i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. i depend on you for that.’” to these high-flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his. “it is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not hope that the period of future happiness, to which miss bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by them.” “caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you. “‘when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that i despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.’ “it is evident by this,” added jane, “that he comes back no more this winter.” “it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should.” “why will you think so? it must be his own doing; he is his own master. but you do not know all. i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from you. ‘mr. darcy is impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. with all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?’ what think you of this sentence, my dear lizzy?” said jane, as she finished it. “is it not clear enough? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard. can there be any other opinion on the subject?” “yes, there can; for mine is totally different. will you hear it?” “most willingly.” “you shall have it in a few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.” jane shook her head. “indeed, jane, you ought to believe me. no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection; miss bingley, i am sure, cannot: she is not such a simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr. darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one inter-marriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way. but, my dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.” “if we thought alike of miss bingley,” replied jane, “your representation of all this might make me quite easy. but i know the foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself.” “that is right. you could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means. you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.” “but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?” “you must decide for yourself,” said elizabeth; “and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you, by all means, to refuse him.” “how can you talk so?” said jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that, though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could not hesitate.” “i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider your situation with much compassion.” “but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. a thousand things may arise in six months.” the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline’s interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone. she represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that bingley would return to netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart. they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. after lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again, during the chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins. elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “it keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and i am more obliged to you than i can express.” charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this was very amiable; but charlotte’s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr. collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. such was miss lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon. but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet. he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. his reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. in as short a time as mr. collins’s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained. sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. mr. collins’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live; and sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr. collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st. james’s. the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte’s dying an old maid. charlotte herself was tolerably composed. she had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. her reflections were in general satisfactory. mr. collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. but still he would be her husband. without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. she resolved to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr. collins, when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and mrs. bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them. “my dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.” they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,-- “but is there not danger of lady catherine’s disapprobation here, my good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness.” “my dear sir,” replied mr. collins, “i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.” “you cannot be too much on your guard. risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.” “believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin elizabeth.” with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. mrs. bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before. the possibility of mr. collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two: but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,-- “engaged to mr. collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!” the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,-- “why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?” but elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. “i see what you are feeling,” replied charlotte; “you must be surprised, very much surprised, so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you. but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic, you know. i never was. i ask only a comfortable home; and, considering mr. collins’s character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.” elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay much longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. the strangeness of mr. collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. she had always felt that charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. charlotte, the wife of mr. collins, was a most humiliating picture! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it, when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,-- “good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?” nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment: but sir william’s good-breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london. mrs. bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing could console and nothing appease her. nor did that day wear out her resentment. a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. mr. bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton. lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though mrs. bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return. jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promised letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. after discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight; for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. mr. collins’s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley’s continued absence. neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs. bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to jane’s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters, and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. as for jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing; and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. it needed all jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. he was too happy, however, to need much attention; and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed. “an excellent consolation in its way,” said elizabeth; “but it will not do for us. we do not suffer by accident. it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.” “but that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. pray, how _violent was_ mr. bingley’s love?” “i never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there be finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?” “oh, yes! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poor jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. it had better have happened to you, lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.” elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence. “i hope,” added mrs. gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. we live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.” “and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? mr. darcy may, perhaps, have heard of such a place as gracechurch street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley never stirs without him.” “so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane correspond with his sister? she will not be able to help calling.” “she will drop the acquaintance entirely.” but, in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley’s being withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane’s attractions. miss bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped, by caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses, the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth’s warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. about ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged. they had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring. mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by character perfectly well. here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. on being made acquainted with the present mr. darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.mr. collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough. “i confess,” said he, “that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship’s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings. i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival?” “i am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied sir william, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. about the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.” scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them. when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to elizabeth,-- “do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter. i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved.” while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas, who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st. james’s. as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects; and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria’s alarm was every moment increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm. elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation. from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine, her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary. in spite of having been at st. james’s, sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought mr. wickham immediately to elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented. when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. miss de bourgh was pale and sickly: her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties, and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended first by him, and then by sir william, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. she inquired into charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others. in the intervals of her discourse with mrs. collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to mrs. collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly. lady catherine then observed,-- “your father’s estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think? for your sake,” turning to charlotte, “i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh’s family. do you play and sing, miss bennet?” “a little.” “oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it some day. do your sisters play and sing?” “one of them does.” “why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned. the miss webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. do you draw?” “no, not at all.” “what, none of you?” “not one.” “that is very strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.” “my mother would have no objection, but my father hates london.” “has your governess left you?” “we never had any governess.” “no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home without a governess! i never heard of such a thing. your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.” elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case. “then who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess, you must have been neglected.” “compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be idle certainly might.” “ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if i had known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way. i am always glad to get a young person well placed out. four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe’s calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure. ‘lady catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ are any of your younger sisters out, miss bennet?” “yes, ma’am, all.” “all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second. the younger ones out before the elder are married! your younger sisters must be very young?” “yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps she is full young to be much in company. but really, ma’am, i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. and to be kept back on such a motive! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.” “upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. pray, what is your age?” “with three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.” lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. “you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age.” “i am not one-and-twenty.” when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed. lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her party. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. a great deal more passed at the other table. lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many. sir william did not say much. he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr. collins’s side, and as many bows on sir william’s, they departed. as soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which, for charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. but her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy mr. collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.sir william stayed only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards. elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement. from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out. very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. she examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs. collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family. elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty. the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr. darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ----; and, to the great surprise of all the party, when mr. collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,-- “i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. mr. darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.” elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merely courtesied to him, without saying a word. colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usual way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,-- “my eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you never happened to see her there?” she was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. the subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. “what can be the meaning of this?” said charlotte, as soon as he was gone. “my dear eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way.” but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. all field sports were over. within doors there was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. they called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former favourite, george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam’s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind. but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand. it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. he seldom appeared really animated. mrs. collins knew not what to make of him. colonel fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success. he certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind. she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs. collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power. in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam. he was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all. himself. as to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. his countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of mr. darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. but no such recollection befriended her. she could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. but, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question. at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin’s corroboration. she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. philips’s. many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week. she remembered, also, that till the netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr. darcy’s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in further justification of mr. darcy, she could not but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued;--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr. bingley was incomprehensible. she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. of neither darcy nor wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd. “how despicably have i acted!” she cried. “i, who have prided myself on my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust. how humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! had i been in love, i could not have been more wretchedly blind. but vanity, not love, has been my folly. pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were concerned. till this moment, i never knew myself.” from herself to jane, from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy’s explanation there had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. widely different was the effect of a second perusal. how could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what charlotte’s opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane. she felt that jane’s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility. when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense of shame was severe. the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers. the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. it soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before. after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation. she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence; mr. darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object. she could think only of her letter. “oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can. daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. and if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and as dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.” “you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our original plan.” lady catherine seemed resigned. “mrs. collins, you must send a servant with them. you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. it is highly improper. you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. miss darcy, the daughter of mr. darcy of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. i am excessively attentive to all those things. you must send john with the young ladies, mrs. collins. i am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.” “my uncle is to send a servant for us.” “oh! your uncle! he keeps a man-servant, does he? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. where shall you change horses? oh, bromley, of course. if you mention my name at the bell, you will be attended to.” lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey; and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary--which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. reflection must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections. mr. darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. she studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. when she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. in her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. they were hopeless of remedy. her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under lydia’s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for ever. anxiety on jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr. darcy’s explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what jane had lost. his affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. how grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! when to these recollections was added the development of wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. the very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh. when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year; and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both.the first week of their return was soon gone. the second began. it was the last of the regiment’s stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. the dejection was almost universal. the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family. “good heaven! what is to become of us? what are we to do?” would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “how can you be smiling so, lizzy?” their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago. “i am sure,” said she, “i cried for two days together when colonel miller’s regiment went away. i thought i should have broke my heart.” “i am sure i shall break mine,” said lydia. “if one could but go to brighton!” observed mrs. bennet. “oh yes!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable.” “a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.” “and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,” added kitty. such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house. elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy’s objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. but the gloom of lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to brighton. this invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. a resemblance in good-humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of their three months’ acquaintance they had been intimate two. the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs. forster, the delight of mrs. bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely to be described. wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. “i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia,” said she, “though i am not her particular friend. i have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older.” in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make her resigned. as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia’s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. he heard her attentively, and then said,-- “lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.” “if you were aware,” said elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you would judge differently in the affair.” “already arisen!” repeated mr. bennet. “what! has she frightened away some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia’s folly.” “indeed, you are mistaken. i have no such injuries to resent. it is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining. our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia’s character. excuse me,--for i must speak plainly. if you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her character will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger kitty is also comprehended. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! oh, my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?” mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and, affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,-- “do not make yourself uneasy, my love. wherever you and jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three--very silly sisters. we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton. let her go, then. colonel forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. the officers will find women better worth their notice. let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.” with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. it was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition. had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation\n"
